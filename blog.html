		<p>Well if you're reading this, it means I finally have internet and I decided this was actually a good idea. Right now, I'm testing out different layouts for the site. I have a few ideas, but I'm still trying to find out which one's the most purdy.
		<br />
		<br />Already, one day after creation, this cruddy website's gone through so much change. In the first version, I just had a bunch of images that linked to my Steam, Twitter, and last.fm accounts. Pretty wild how much things can change in just a few short hours! Even now, there's so much stuff I wanna add!
		<br />
		<br />Dear god, it's just one plane flight after another. At first I liked being on a plane, but now I just wanna jump into the nearest bed and pass out for a good week or two. Hey, at least I'll be able to update the site and talk to people when I get off.
		<br />
		<br />I'm probably spending too much time working on this site. At least I'm having a lot of fun making it? I dunno. It's not like it's impeding on my already small social life. I feel like this'll be something I sink a ton of time into over the years, like a side project that I keep adding shit to. I dunno if github has a limit on how much stuff a site can have, but I'll keep pushing this damn thing 'til I find out.
		<br />
		<br />First, I spent 12 hours on a plane. Then, I spent another 4 hours in a car. Now, I'm gonna spend 8 years in a bed. Thank fucking god. I can only spend so much time adding images to a gallery before I go insane.
		<br />
		<br />FOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!
		<br />
		<br />Well that celebration ended really quickly. My tard younger sister dumped a shitton of coffee all over the car and everything in it, including my PC. Luckily, it doesn't seem like anything's harmed. Still, it's enough to fuck up my good mood. Hopefully we'll reach this house before I blow my brains out.
		<br />
		<br />Finally in a bed. I feel amazing.
		<br />
		<br />And I still have no internet. I kinda expected this.
		<br />
		<br />Woke up with a tall glass of Sunny D. I didn't even know Sunny D was still a thing, I would've expected that they'd gone outta business a long time ago.
		<br />
		<br />Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I'm so boooooooored.
		<br />
		<br />Well, that house was fucking awful. It felt like the place was falling apart every second we were there.
